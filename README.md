# Config-Driven Pipeline Plugin Test

This repository contains a simple project that will use the 
[examples/script/Jenkinsfile](https://github.com/jenkinsci/config-driven-pipeline-plugin/master/examples/script/Jenkinfile) 
file from https://github.com/jenkinsci/config-driven-pipeline-plugin by specifying that path
in the `.myci.yml` file as `pipeline_template`'s value.
